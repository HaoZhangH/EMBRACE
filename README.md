<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

To aid researchers in aligning their work with these best practices, we developed this checklist that aims to enhance understanding of the feasibility of proposed projects, the completeness of ongoing research, and the robustness of finished work. Before using the checklist, please read previously published and review work and viewpoint for specific terminologies and concepts.

* A comprehensive review study was conducted to investigate common pitfalls and best ML practices in Environmental Science and Engineering (ESE) areas, please check: Zhu, J. J., Yang, M., & Ren, Z. J. (2023). Machine learning in environmental research: common pitfalls and best practices. Environmental Science & Technology, 57(46), 17671-17689. [https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.3c00026](https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.3c00026)
* A viewpoint summarizes the general usage of this checklist and advocates to better faciliate an engaged learning community in ESE, please check: Zhu, J. J., xxx, & Ren, Z. J. (2024). A Stepwise Checklist for Environmental Machine Learning: From Minimum to Best Practices. Environmental Science & Technology, xxxxxx. [xxxxxx](xxxxxx)

The ultimate goal of introducing this checklist is to foster an active learning community and promote self-beneficial practices in environmental and sustainability ML research. We sincerely hope to foster a vibrant and reliable community for environmental ML research, potentially establishing standards that benefit the broader community by engaging more contributors.




## Getting Started

The checklist includes two major sections:
* Section A is a quick self-check table that summarizes major, quantitative indicators. 
* Section B is a more detailed, step-by-step checklist for ordinary supervised machine learning (ML) model development. 
Section B also a preliminary feasibility assessment table. Please decide if you plan to (1) evaluate project feasibility, (2) perform a quick self-check, or (3) conduct a comprehensive stepwise checklist.


### Prerequisites

Please read the review work and viewpoint before using the checklist. When using the checklist, you can refer to the instructions for additional information.

### Workflow

The viewpoint includes a figure that illustrates the recommended workflow amd usage of the checklist. You may pinpoint where you are and start from that standpoint.

## Usage

There are three types of checklist documents can be selected: A (only Section A), B (only Section B), and Full (both sections). The selection could faciliate a more flexible sharing of corresponding section(s). To share your checklist with others, please save the checklist as a read-only document. “File” >> “Print” >> Select “Microsoft print to PDF” in “Printer” >> Print >> Save it as a new PDF document.
_For more examples, please refer to the [Instructions](https://example.com)_



## Interactions and Contributing

* If you find this checklist useful, please help to spread it to build an engaging community. If the checklist helps your ML research, we appreciate your credit to our work. Please cite the viewpoint [xxxxxx](xxxxxx).
* If you'd like to share your checklist data for your research/publication, please send your checklist to Dr. Jun-Jie Zhu (junjiez@princeton.edu) via email. Please name your checklist document "Finisheddate BMP Checklist versionnumber for Yourpublication" (e.g., "20240430 BMP Checklist 1.0 for Zhu et al. (2023)") and use an email title "Sharing BMP Checklist from Yourname" (e.g., "Sharing BMP Checklist from Junjie Zhu"). To better classify shared checlist, please also provide your research application domain (e.g., Predicting river water quality parameter, TSS concentration) in your email. We will do a data completeness check and publish it if it is informative and within the scope. It is worth noting that sharing your checklist is completely volunteer and you agree to release your document/information once you send your document to us. Therefore, we and other fellow researchers appreciate your sharing. If you previously shared your checklist, but you'd like to update the existing document, please identify the document and explain the reason. We will revise it accordingly.
* While sharing your checklist may also benefit your research impact (i.e., more colleagues will know your research), it is completely self QA/QC for reported data. From the prespective of other fellow researchers, when you learn from a checklist, the information accuracy of the checklist is completely based upon the reporting researcher. While we encourage researchers to share their checklists, it is more important to provide a responsible data reporting.
* If you find other items are needed or useful to be added to the existing checklist, especially if they are common and representaitve in ESE areas, please feel free to send email to Dr. Jun-Jie Zhu (junjiez@princeton.edu). It is likely that your suggestion will be accepted or acknowledged for future development of the checklist.
