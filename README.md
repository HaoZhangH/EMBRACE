<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

To aid researchers in aligning their work with these best practices, we developed the EMBRACE Checklist that aims to enhance understanding of the feasibility of proposed projects, the completeness of ongoing research, and the robustness of finished work. Before adopting the checklist, please consult previously published review work and viewpoint for specific terminologies and concepts.

* A comprehensive review study was conducted to investigate common pitfalls and best ML practices in Environmental Science and Engineering (ESE) areas, please check: Zhu, J. J., Yang, M., & Ren, Z. J. (2023). Machine learning in environmental research: common pitfalls and best practices. Environmental Science & Technology, 57(46), 17671-17689. [https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.3c00026](https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.3c00026)
* A viewpoint summarizes the general usage of this checklist and advocates to better faciliate an engaged learning community in ESE, please check: Zhu, J. J., Boehm, A. B., & Ren, Z. J. (2024). Environmental Machine-learning, Baseline Reporting, And Comprehensive Evaluation: The EMBRACE Checklist. Environmental Science & Technology, Submitted. [xxxxxx](xxxxxx)

The ultimate goal of introducing this checklist is to foster an active learning community and promote self-beneficial practices in environmental ML research. We sincerely hope to foster a vibrant and reliable community for environmental ML research. I encourage interested researchers to join and contribute this effort, potentially establishing standards that benefit the broader community.

## Getting Started

The checklist includes "project overview" and eight sections that follow a typical flowchart of ML model development:
* Project overview helps to record the general information of your ongoing or finished study. You can also use it to track potential problems during your research.
* Section 1 includes reporting study objectives and feasibility assessment, aiding researchers in evaluating their available resources more effectively.
* Section 2 covers reporting on data sources, including types, ethics, as well as details regarding the number and quality of data points.
* Section 3 outlines reporting on data cleaning, enrichment, feature engineering, data splitting, and final data descriptions.
* Section 4 focuses on reporting the supervised learning methods chosen and the overall modeling framework.
* Section 5 highlights key aspects of model evaluation and hyperparameter optimization (HPO).
* Section 6 emphasizes the need for a deeper understanding and reporting of model interpretability, explainability, and causality.
* Section 7 focuses verifying data leakage management.
* Section 8 encourages the sharing of data and code when possible.


### Prerequisites

Please read the review work and viewpoint before using the checklist. When using the checklist, you can refer to the instructions for additional information.

### Workflow

The checklist can be used at any stage of life cycle of your research, including project initialization, ongoing work, finished study, and educational learning.

## Usage

The checklist is designed to easy check and fill. You may consult instructions for detailed explanations. To share your checklist with others, you can save the checklist as a read-only document. 
* When using Microsoft Windows, please follow these step: “File” >> “Print” >> Select “Microsoft print to PDF” in “Printer” >> Print >> Save it as a new PDF document.

## Interactions and Contributing

* If you find this checklist useful, please help to spread it to build an engaging community for environmental ML research. If the checklist helps your ML research, we appreciate your credit to our work. Please cite the viewpoint [xxxxxx](xxxxxx).
* If you'd like to share your checklist data for your research or publication, please send your checklist to Dr. Junjie Zhu at Princeton University (junjiez@princeton.edu or ranmuweijie@gmail.com) via email. Please name your checklist document "Finished_date BMP Checklist version_number for Your_research" (e.g., "20240430 BMP Checklist 1.0 for Zhu et al. (2023)") and use an email title "Sharing BMP Checklist from Your_name" (e.g., "Sharing BMP Checklist from Junjie Zhu"). To better classify the shared checklists, please also provide your research application domain (e.g., Predicting river water quality parameter, TSS concentration) in your email. We will do a quick data completeness inspection and publish it ASAP. It is worth noting that sharing your checklist is completely volunteer per your agreement on releasing your research information once you send your document to us. Therefore, we and other fellow researchers appreciate your sharing. If you shared your checklist and would like to update the existing document, please identify the document and explain the reason. We will revise it accordingly.
* Sharing your checklist may enhance the impact of your research by increasing visibility among colleagues. Therefore, it is important to ensure the accuracy of reported data, which is completely a self-responsible QA/QC. From the prespective of other fellow researchers, the accuracy of the checklist information relies solely on the reporting researcher. While we encourage researchers to share their checklists, it is crucial to ensure responsible data reporting.
* If you find other imprtant items need to be added or there are any places need to be corrected, particularly if they are common and representative in ESE areas, please feel free to send email to Dr. Junjie Zhu. When pointing the item, please also provide your thoughts with supporting materials. It is likely that your suggestion will be accepted for future development of the checklist.
