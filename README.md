<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

To aid researchers in aligning their work with these best practices, we developed this checklist that aims to enhance understanding of the feasibility of proposed projects, the completeness of ongoing research, and the robustness of finished work. Before using the checklist, please read previously published and review work and viewpoint for specific terminologies and concepts.

* A comprehensive review study was conducted to investigate common pitfalls and best ML practices in Environmental Science and Engineering (ESE) areas, please check: Zhu, J. J., Yang, M., & Ren, Z. J. (2023). Machine learning in environmental research: common pitfalls and best practices. Environmental Science & Technology, 57(46), 17671-17689. [https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.3c00026](https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.3c00026)
* A viewpoint summarizes the general usage of this checklist and advocates to better faciliate an engaged learning community in ESE, please check: Zhu, J. J., xxx, & Ren, Z. J. (2024). A Stepwise Checklist for Environmental Machine Learning: From Minimum to Best Practices. Environmental Science & Technology, xxxxxx. [xxxxxx](xxxxxx)

The ultimate goal of introducing this checklist is to foster an active learning community and promote self-beneficial practices in environmental and sustainability ML research. We sincerely hope to foster a vibrant and reliable community for environmental ML research, potentially establishing standards that benefit the broader community by engaging more contributors.




<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

The checklist includes two major sections:
•	Section A is a quick self-check table that summarizes major, quantitative indicators. 
•	Section B is a more detailed, step-by-step checklist for ordinary supervised machine learning (ML) model development. 
Section B also a preliminary feasibility assessment table. Please decide if you plan to 1) evaluate project feasibility, 2) perform a quick self-check, or 3) conduct a comprehensive stepwise checklist.


### Prerequisites

Please read the review work and viewpoint before using the checklist. When using the checklist, you can refer to the instructions for additional information.

### Workflow

The viewpoint includes a figure that illustrates the recommended workflow amd usage of the checklist. You may pinpoint where you are and start from that standpoint.

## Usage

There are three checklist documents can be selected: A (only Section A), B (only Section B), and Full (both sections). The selection could faciliate a more flexible sharing of corresponding section(s). To share your checklist with others, please save the checklist as a read-only document. “File” >> “Print” >> Select “Microsoft print to PDF” in “Printer” >> Print >> Save it as a new PDF document.
_For more examples, please refer to the [Instructions](https://example.com)_
