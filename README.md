# Best ML Practices
A Stepwise Checklist for Environmental Researchers to  Conduct a Supervised Machine Learning Study
**A comprehensive review study was conducted to investigate ML practices in ESE areas, please check: [https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.3c00026](https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.3c00026)
**To help the fellower researchers better develop robust models, we're preparing a comprehensive checklist. We plan to publish it as a paper as well as share the details here.
# We're currently developing it, stay tuned!
